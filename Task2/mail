Subject: Request for a Deadline Extension

Dear {Account Manager Name},

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request an extension of the deadline for the {task name} task.

Unfortunately, due to a family emergency, I will not be able to meet the original due date of {date}. In light of this, I would like to take tomorrow's date as the new due date for the task.

I understand that this request may cause some inconvenience and apologize for any disruption. However, your understanding in this situation is much appreciated.

If there is anything else required from me in order to complete this task, please do let me know and I will do my best to provide it as soon as possible.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Arun Teja
